# Corpus based analysis of indefinite article use by Saudi ESL learners: evidence from spoken data 

Abdulmajeed's Data Science project analyzing indefinite English article use by Arabic L1 learners.

## 

**This study examines the use of indefinite articles by L1 Arabic learners of English. Specifically, it examines the production of indefinite articles and contexts where an indefinite article is required. There are many studies arguing that Modern Standard Arabic does not mark indefiniteness while there are some that argue it does. The goal of this study is to determine whether Arabic marks indefiniteness overtly by examining indefinite article use in English by Arabic L1 learners. If Arabic does not mark indefiniteness overtly, then it should be expected that omission will occur in indefinite contexts. If Arabic does mark it overtly, then learners should be more consistent in their production of English indefinite articles. The data used in this study is from [Vercellotti, M. L. (2017)](https://slabank.talkbank.org/access/0docs/Vercellotti2017.pdf) which was made available on [TalkBank](https://slabank.talkbank.org/access/English/Vercellotti.html).**
