## Description

This study examines the use of indefinite articles by L1 Arabic learners of English to determine whether or not Arabic has an indefinite marker. This study examines the use of indefinite articles by L1 Arabic learners of English to determine whether or not Arabic has an indefinite marker. It is unclear in the literature on Arabic grammar whether indefiniteness is marked. In particular, the phenomenon of ‘nunation’ has left researchers divided on the matter. Nunation is a /n/ sound added to the end of words following a short vowel sound. Some of the work done on Arabic grammar claims that nunation is a marker of indefiniteness while some argues against this account.

## Data

The study utilizes corpus data from [TalkBank](https://slabank.talkbank.org/access/English/Vercellotti.html) (MacWhinney, 2019) that was made available by [Vercellotti, M. L. (2017)](https://slabank.talkbank.org/access/0docs/Vercellotti2017.pdf). The data includes transcripts of spoken data from Saudi ESL learners that were used to analyze indefinite article production in English by L1 Arabic speakers to understand the nature of nunation.
