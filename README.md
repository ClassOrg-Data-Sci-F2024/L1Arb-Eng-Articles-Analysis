# L1Arb-Eng-Articles-Analysis
Abdulmajeed's Data Science project analyzing indefinite English article use by Arabic L1 learners.


## Comparing L2 English indefinite article use in speaking vs writing by Arab learners.


### The consensus is that Arabic does not have a morphological marker of indefiniteness (there are arguments for the opposite but, to my knowledge, no convincing evidence exists). There is work that analyzes English article use of Arabic-speaking learners. However, the data in these studies either analyze results from elicitation tasks given to learners or focus on corpus analysis of written production, very little work exists on spoken data analysis for article production from Arab learners of English. The plan for this project is to analyze the use of English indefinite articles by Arabic L1 learners in writing vs speaking. More specifically, do Arab learners of English have the same level of accuracy in their use of indefinite English articles in writing vs speaking?
