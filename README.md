# L1Arb-Eng-Articles-Analysis
Abdulmajeed's Data Science project analyzing indefinite English article use by Arabic L1 learners.

### This project aims to analyze errors made by L1 Arabic learners of English in using indefinite articles. The project will analyze transcripts of spoken data from TalkBank to see whether Arabic learners' use of indefinite articles in English is due to the transfer of nunation (a feature of Arabic whose true nature as an indefinite marker has been heavily debated) as a marker of indefiniteness or specifity.
