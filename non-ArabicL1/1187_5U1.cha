*1187:	<of something's> [//] &~ba &~s something &~s &~i bad word they will using tha(t) . 22975_27598
*1187:	an(d) I think &~i <maybe in the> [//] maybe the &~p grow up person they didn't mention this one because they've maybe just ah make fun with some bad wor(d) . 28102_39487
*1187:	but I think that will influence the childrens because children they didn't know the something's good or not . 43822_44293
*1187:	they can't &~dec decide . 47768_48069
*1187:	so they were just learning .

*1187:	and I don't thinks that is a good way because &-uh the children they [/] they will &~as &~res receive a_lot_of the bad influence on tv or movie . 61630_69894
*1187:	so I think this [//] these kind of the violence in the &~me medias should be censured some time should be banned . 71171_79418
*1187:	because in my opinions I think &-um s:omething ah violence is really rude and bad . 81859_88054
*1187:	and I think the children they can't control this one .
*1187:	so they just receive and do that . 92255_92594
*1187:	so I think the [/] mm the best way to solve this &~sh situation is &-uh the [//] &~ka &~the their parent should be accompany &~wi with the children . 94183_102810
*1187:	that will improve the situation .
*1187:	<they the children> [//] the parents <should be> [//] should teach their children do not learn from the violence &~a and [//] &~i on tv and movie . 107193_120191
