# Corpus based analysis of indefinite article use by Saudi ESL learners: evidence from spoken data

## Introduction

This study examines the use of indefinite articles by L1 Arabic learners of English to determine whether or not Arabic has an indefinite marker. It is unclear in the literature on Arabic grammar whether indefiniteness is marked. In particular, the phenomenon of ‘nunation’ has left researchers divided on the matter. Nunation is a /n/ sound added to the end of words following a short vowel sound. Some of the work done on Arabic grammar claims that nunation is a marker of indefiniteness on account of its complementary distribution with the definite article “al” (Abu-Chacra, 2007; Ryding, 2005; Schulz, 2004; Versteegh, 2014). The examples below, adopted from Jarrah and Zibin (2016a), demonstrate this complementary distribution (nun = nunation):

1.  

**a**. ʃtarait-u ʔal-kitaab-a

Buy.PAST-I The-book-ACC

“I bought the book.”

**b**. ʃtarait-u kitaab-a-[**n**]{.underline}

Buy.PAST-I book-ACC-**nun**

“I bought a book.”

**c**. ʃtarait-u (\*ʔal-)kitaab-a-**n**

buy.PAST-I (\*the)book-ACC-**nun**

‘I bought a book’

In 1(a), “kitaab” is definite and thus tagged with the definite article “*al*”. In 1(b), “kitaab” is indefinite and tagged with nunation. 1(c) highlights the complementary distribution of “al” and nunation because it is not possible to tag a noun with both.

On the other hand, there are many arguments against nunation as an indefinite article (Fassi Fehri, 1993, 2012; Jarrah & Zibin, 2016a, 2016b; Lyons 1999, among others). Fassi Fehri (1993, 2012) argues against nunation as an indefinite marker on account of its presence on proper nouns. In 2, the proper noun ‘Mohammad’ is marked with nunation despite being definite by nature.

2.  

raʔai-tu mohammad-a-**n** fi-s-suuq-i

see.PAST-1S Mohammad-ACC-**nun** in-DEF-market-GEN

‘I saw Mohammad in the market.’

Alzamil (2023) realized the role a speaker's dialect might play in determining the nature of nunation as an indefinite article. Therefore, he examined Saudi Arabic speakers of two dialects, Najdi and Hijazi, and analyzed their use of indefinite articles in English. Najdi Arabic uses nunation (as shown in 3a below) while Hijazi Arabic does not (3b). Alzamil’s (2023) results showed that the participants struggled to use *‘a’* more than ‘ø’. However, Najdi speakers used ‘*a*’ correctly more than Hijazi speakers “(the average for Najdi speakers was 52% and for Hijazi speakers 41%)”. Alzamil (2023) argued that this might be related to the fact that Najdi uses nunation while Hijazi does not, suggesting that it was evidence in support of the view that nunation was an indefinite marker. However, the difference between the average correct use of the English indefinite article by Najdi speakers (52%) is not that much higher than Hijazi speakers (41%), thus, it does not present conclusive evidence that nunation is an indefinite article.

3.  

**a**. (**Najdi**)

Tikalamt maʕ radʒali**-n** ams. kan zīmili.

Talked-I with man-**nun** yesterday. was friend-my.

‘I talked with a man yesterday. He was my friend.’

**b**. (**Hijazi**)

Tikalamt maʕ riʒʒal ams. kan zāmili.

Talked-I with man yesterday. was friend-my.

‘I talked with a man yesterday. He was my friend.’

This study will take a similar approach to the analysis done by Alzamil (2023). It will analyze corpus data from Saudi ESL learners to provide more insights on the nature of nunation by investigating their use of indefinite articles in English. However, unlike Alzamil's (2023) data, the corpus used in this study does not include information about speakers' dialects, which could be a contributing factor. The research question guiding this analysis is the following:

-   Does Saudi ESL learner’s production of indefinite English articles provide evidence that nunation is an indefinite marker in Arabic? 

## Data

The data in this study comes from a corpus of spoken data compiled in TalkBank (MacWhinney, 2019) by Vercellotti (2017). The participants in the corpus have different L1s: 43 Arabic speakers, 16 Chinese speakers, and 7 Korean speakers. Chinese and Korean speakers were filtered out for the purposes of this analysis, leaving 43 Arabic L1 participants. The participants were adults in an Intensive English Program (IEP) in the United States. The data in this corpus were collected during class meetings as part of the speaking curriculum of the program. The monologues provided by participants were roughly two-minutes long on different topics that varied by level and semester. The main part of the corpus that is analyzed in this study is the transcripts that were done by native speakers experienced in non-native speech transcription.

In this study, a distinction is made between participant and contribution. That is, a single participant might have contributed monologues in the low-intermediate, high-intermediate, and low-advanced levels. Some participants in the corpus only contributed in one level, while others contributed in all three levels. The contributions made are: 54 in the low-intermediate, 120 in the high-intermediate, and 34 in the low-advanced.

## Analysis

The transcripts from the corpus were tagged with a *part of speech tagger* to extract the tokens of Englsih indefinite article use by participants. *Correct* uses of indefinite articles in English were identified by examining instances of *a/an* followed by a singular count noun, which may or may not be preceded by a modifier. The other tokens of Englsih indefinite article use include *incorrect-PL* for incorrect use with plural nouns, *incorrect-MS* for incorrect use with mass nouns, and *incorrect-null* for incorrectly omitting the indefinite article in obligatory contexts. Incorrect uses with plural and mass nouns were identified simply by examining instances of *a/an* followed by a plural or mass noun, which may or may not be preceded by a modifier. Incorrect omissions were identified by examining instances of singular count nouns that were not preceded by an article. For incorrect omissions, the examination included two words on either side of the singular count noun to insure the article did not precede a modifier or that the singular count noun was not a modifier of a plural or mass noun.

## Results

Overall, the tokens in which the indefinite article was used correctly (correct) were substantially more frequent than tokens where an indefinite article was used incorrectly with plural nouns (incorrect-PL), used incorrectly with mass nouns (incorrect-MS), or omitted from obligatory contexts (incorrect-null). Table 1 shows the frequency of uses in each type of token per level. Across all three levels, indefinite articles were used correctly 428 times, incorrectly with mass nouns 21 times, incorrectly with plural nouns 23 times, and omitted from obligatory contexts 87 times. Figure 1 shows the frequency of indefinite article use per type for each level.

**Table 1**

*Correct and incorrect uses of indefinite articles.*

|----------|---------|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| low-int  | 83      | 30             | 5            | 6            |
| high-int | 276     | 47             | 11           | 11           |
| low-adv  | 69      | 10             | 5            | 6            |

Additionally, individuals' production in each type of use (correct, incorrect-MS, incorrect-PL, incorrect-null) was analyzed to ensure that a single participant did not produce the majority of tokens in each type. Figure 2 shows participants' contribution of tokens. For better visibility, and considering the significantly low frequency of incorrect-MS and incorrect-PL, they were left out of the visualization in Figure 2 after ensuring that most tokens came from different participants. There appear to be some outliers in the low-intermediate and high-intermediate levels' production of correct and incorrect-null tokens. However, it is only a very small number of participants, and whether or not they remain will not change the large difference between the correct tokens and the incorrect tokens.

## Discussion

The results of the present analysis seem to point to a similar conclusion to the one by Alzamil (2023). The frequency of the correct use of the indefinite article “*a/an*” is much higher than incorrect uses and omissions of the article in obligatory contexts. There are two possibilities for how Arabic marks indefiniteness:

1)  it marks it overtly via nunation.

2)  it marks covertly via the absence of the definite article.

The results of this analysis point to nunation being an indefinite article in Arabic because there is no other morpheme in Arabic that is associated with indefiniteness.

In addition to the overwhelming frequency of correct use of the indefinite article, the errors made in the use of the indefinite article with plural and mass nouns could be used in support of the argument that nunation is an indefinite marker. This is because Arabic marks indefinite singular, plural, and mass nouns with nunation. The examples in 4 below show the presence of nunation on indefinite singular and plural nouns (a and b respectively) and mass nouns (c). If nunation is in fact an indefinite marker, this would explain the incorrect use of the English indefinite article with plural and mass nouns as negative transfer from L1, which supports the view that nunation is an indefinite marker.

‘I ate white rice’

## Limitations and Future Research

One important factor to consider is that the participants in this corpus were students in a language program in the United States. This means they were exposed to L2 input and likely received instruction and corrective feedback on the use of the English indefinite article. Therefore, ensuring minimal L2 instruction might yield better results. In addition, as mentioned earlier, the corpus does not include information about speakers' dialects. This might be an important factor since nunation is not present in all Arabic dialects (for example, Najdi Arabic has nunation while Hijazi Arabic does not). Future research should focus on identifying speakers' dialects for more reliable results. This would be easier to do if the data is collected for the study rather than using corpus data since the participants' can report their own dialects.

## Project Reflection

The project started with a theoretical concept that took a good amount of time to develop. The early stages of the project focused more on reading through the literature to get an understanding of the theory. I already knew from the beginning what type of data was best for the analysis and knew where to find it. The biggest difficulty I faced was understanding both arguments for and against nunation as an indefinite marker and trying to be unbiased as a native speaker of Arabic when doing the analysis and writing the report. This meant that I had to be careful not to direct my analysis to highlight one view over the other. Another obstacle I faced during the analysis was cleaning the transcripts from CHAT formatting to prepare them for POS tagging, which took a long time. Lastly, I initially did not plan to analyze individuals' production of the tokens in each level, but, even though I ended up not removing any observations, analyzing their production made me more confident in my analysis.
